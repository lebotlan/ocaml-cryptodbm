   {2 Encrypted layer over the dbm library: serverless, key-value databases with symmetric encryption.}

  This library provides an encrypted layer on top of the {{:https://github.com/ocaml/dbm}Dbm} and {{:https://github.com/xavierleroy/cryptokit/}Cryptokit} packages. 
  The improvements over Dbm are:

  {ul
  {- A single database file may contain {b several independent subtables}, identified by a name (a string).}
  {- Each subtable can be {b signed and encrypted individually}, or encrypted using a global password.}
  {- The whole file can be signed.}
  {- {b Obfuscating data} is -optionally- appended to keys, data, and to the whole table, so that two databases with
    the same content look significantly different, once encrypted.}
  {- Encryption is symmetric: encryption and decryption both use the same password.}
  {- Signature is symmetric: signing and verifying the signature both use the same signword.}
 }

    As a quick example, the following uncrypted bindings (key => data):

    {v
        "john-doe"        => "age 36"
        "some secret"     => "The cake is a lie."
        "Motto"           => "For relaxing times, make it Suntory time" v}

    are stored as follows in the encrypted file (with variations depending on the password, and other parameters):

{v 
 [S~j....O.Q..tk^.2] => [...F...).Hsl..tB]
 [...y;....~.:.6V.2] => [....I...JR..w.E9..G..q=...K....b]
 [..'.C...F.x.3K.y2] => [1.)9q..M...et.b.]
 [S.....5 Y....8..2] => [.D........2..u...q.......}Z.b..z.zo.}.l3l.....>.]
 [...xD;@.8..wV..P1....e}....u..`.2] => [hb..2.._B....Y?0....|.....tM....]
 [K.#i.7j..H.ZZ.^.2] => [..z....,........] v}

    Including several subtables in the same
    database file avoids having to deal with multiple files to store related information, 
    and also prevents information leak through the number and sizes of a set of database files.

    This library was primarily designed to store encrypted exam files on a university server. A common layout consists in
    several subtables encrypted with a global password, as well as an uncrypted subtable containing (public) meta-information.

    {b Install and compile}

    Install using opam: [opam install cryptodbm]

    Compile with ocamlbuild by adding the following to your _tags file: 
    {v <**/*> : package(cryptodbm) v}

    {b Performance}

    I have not benchmarked this library. 
    Keep in mind that every access (reading or writing a binding) requires to encrypt the key,
    and encrypt the data (when writing) or decrypt the data (when reading).
    Don't be pessimistic, though: it seems all right for non critical applications.

    Also, there is only a global key-index for the whole table, no key-index for individual subtables. As a consequence,
    subtable iterators actually iterate over the whole table index (selecting only the expected subtable indexes).

    {b A few technical details}

    When a database file is encrypted, 

    {ul    
    {- The only uncrypted binding in the file is the format version number, as well as bindings of uncrypted subtables.}
    {- Because of salt(s), it is not possible for an observer to see when two databases use the same password. }
    {- Because of salt(s), saving twice the same database leads to two files containing totally different bindings.
       An observer cannot make sure that two databases are equal. However, if the following options are not used, the
       total number of bindings is the same, as well as the sizes of bindings (which entails that the file sizes are the same too).}
    {- If "max_extra padding" is used, saving twice the same database leads to two files containing bindings with different sizes.
       If "extra bindings" is used, the total number of bindings is, moreover, different.
       It is harder for an observer to guess if two database files are possibly equal.}
    {- Because data is encrypted using the salt, password and key, data associated to different keys are encrypted differently.
       An observer cannot identify bindings with equal data.}
    {- The signature is computed by hashing the salt, signword, all (subtabled) keys and associated data. It is stored after
       encryption using the salt and the (sub)table password. The hashing function is currently sha256 (see the Cryptokit package).}

(** {3 Basics} *)

(** The type of encrypted-dbm file descriptors. 
    'a is a phantom type precising the permission: read-only or full access. *)
type 'a table

(** Phantom type which represents read-only permission. *)

(** {3 Open, close, and flush files} *)

(** The database can be opened in three modes: 
    read mode, write (create) mode, and append mode.

    Note that operations are not thread-safe at the library level: do not share a table or subtable handler between threads.
    However, multiple processes might access the same database, whenever the low-level dbm permits it
    (which depends on the low-level dbm library actually used). 
    gdbm allows many readers in parallel, or only one writer and no reader. *)
